Building something interesting requires a surplus of time and money. Salaried jobs provide neither. Unless the job itself is your dream, stay the fuck away from them.

surplus of time and money:(extra, more than enough time and money)
he has a surplus of time and money, so he spend his days traveling.

"My ridiculous intake of over six cups of coffee daily definitely pushed me over the edge, but it was only the catalyst, not the cause.
https://levels.io/reset-your-life/
pushed me over the edge: "The phrase "pushed me over the edge" typically means that something caused a person to reach their breaking point emotionally, mentally, or in terms of patience. It suggests that the person was already close to their limit, and the event or action pushed them beyond their capacity to cope or remain composed."
自作英文:
"coding 8h straight literally pushed me over the edge.
