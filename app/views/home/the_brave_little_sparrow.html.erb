    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
      Once upon a time, in a small forest near a village, there lived a little sparrow named Chirpy. Chirpy was the smallest of all the birds in the forest. Her feathers were brown and plain, and her chirp was soft. The other birds teased her and said, “You are too small to do anything important!”
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
      Chirpy felt sad but always smiled. She loved to fly and explore the forest. Every morning, she would fly high and look at the big trees, colorful flowers, and blue sky. Chirpy dreamed of doing something special one day.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-4">The Forest in Danger</h2>
    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
      One sunny day, Chirpy saw something unusual. A group of humans came into the forest with loud machines. They started cutting down trees. The animals were scared. The squirrels ran to hide in their burrows. The deer ran deep into the forest, and the birds flew away in fear.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
      Chirpy’s home was in one of the tall trees near the edge of the forest. She watched as the humans cut down the tree where her friend, a wise old owl, lived. Chirpy flew to the owl and asked, “What can we do? They are destroying our home!”
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
      The wise owl said, “Little Chirpy, we must stop them. But I am too old to fly far. Maybe you can ask for help.”
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
      “But I’m too small,” said Chirpy, her voice shaking.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
      “You may be small, but you have a big heart,” the owl replied. “Sometimes, even the smallest ones can make the biggest difference.”
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-4">Chirpy’s Plan</h2>
    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
      Chirpy decided to be brave. She flew to the deepest part of the forest where the eagles lived. The eagles were strong and powerful. Chirpy landed carefully on a rock and chirped softly, “Excuse me, mighty eagles. The humans are cutting down our forest. Can you help us?”
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
      One of the eagles looked at Chirpy and said, “You are too small to give us orders. Go back to your nest.”
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
      Chirpy didn’t give up. She said, “I may be small, but if the forest is gone, you will lose your home too. Please, think about it.”
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
      The eagles whispered to each other. Finally, the leader said, “We will help, but we need more birds.”
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
      Chirpy thanked them and flew to the other parts of the forest. She spoke to parrots, woodpeckers, and robins. She told them about the danger. Many birds joined her. Soon, Chirpy had gathered a big group of birds.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-4">The Fight for the Forest</h2>
    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
      The next morning, the humans came back with more machines. They started cutting trees again. This time, Chirpy and the birds were ready. The eagles flew high and scared the humans by circling above them. The woodpeckers pecked on the metal machines, making loud noises. The parrots screamed and squawked to get the humans' attention.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
      Chirpy flew close to the leader of the humans. She chirped loudly and flapped her wings in front of his face. The man waved his hands to shoo her away, but Chirpy didn’t stop. She was brave and determined.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
      The humans were surprised and confused. They had never seen so many birds working together. Finally, they stopped their machines. One of the humans said, “Maybe we should find another place. This forest is full of life.”
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-4">A Happy Ending</h2>
    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
      The humans packed their machines and left the forest. The animals and birds cheered. The wise old owl smiled at Chirpy and said, “You were right. Even a small sparrow can do great things.”
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
      Chirpy felt proud. She looked at her forest, safe and green, and realized she had done something special. From that day, the other birds never teased Chirpy again. Instead, they called her “Chirpy the Brave.”
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-4">Moral of the Story</h2>
    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
      Even if you are small, you can achieve big things with courage and determination. Never give up, and always believe in yourself.
    </p>
